# Cybryst Pro - How It Works

## Executive Summary

Cybryst Pro addresses the critical bottleneck in digital forensics identified by Ngo & Le-Khac (2023) and Silva et al. (2024) - the manual structuring of unstructured cybersecurity incident reports. This system implements a sophisticated two-stage LLM pipeline that autonomously converts raw, prose-based incident reports into structured, ontology-ready knowledge instances suitable for immediate ingestion into DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) knowledge management systems.

## System Architecture Overview

The system is built on a modular architecture consisting of two primary components:

1. **Artifact Extractor Module (Stage 1)**: Identifies and extracts core digital forensic data
2. **Reasoning and Mapping Module (Stage 2)**: Applies Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought reasoning for strategic mapping

### Technology Stack

- **LLM Provider**: Groq API for low-latency inference
- **Primary Models**: 
  - Stage 1: Llama 3.1-70B-Versatile (for artifact extraction)
  - Stage 2: Mixtral-8x7B-32768 (for reasoning and mapping)
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Output Format**: Structured JSON suitable for ontology ingestion

## Detailed System Operation

### Stage 1: Artifact Extractor Module

#### Purpose and Functionality
The Artifact Extractor Module serves as the foundational stage of the knowledge acquisition pipeline. It takes unstructured, prose-based cybersecurity incident reports as input and systematically identifies and extracts all relevant digital forensic artifacts with their associated properties and contextual metadata.

#### Input Processing
- **Input**: Raw text from cybersecurity incident reports (prose narratives)
- **Format Support**: Plain text files (.txt, .md)
- **Preprocessing**: Minimal preprocessing to preserve original context and meaning

#### Artifact Extraction Process

The module employs a sophisticated prompt engineering approach to identify and extract the following critical artifact types:

1. **Network Indicators**
   - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
   - Domain names and URLs
   - Network ports and protocols
   - Email addresses

2. **File System Indicators**
   - File hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512)
   - File paths and directories
   - Registry keys and values

3. **Process and System Indicators**
   - Process names and PIDs
   - User accounts and usernames
   - Malware names and families
   - Attack tools and utilities

4. **Temporal Indicators**
   - Timestamps and dates
   - MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs

#### Extraction Methodology

For each identified artifact, the system extracts:

- **Type**: Precise artifact category classification
- **Value**: Exact artifact value as found in the report
- **Properties**: Additional metadata (hash type, tool version, privilege level, etc.)
- **Context**: Discovery location and usage context within the report
- **Confidence**: Extraction confidence level (high/medium/low)

#### Technical Implementation

```python
class ArtifactExtractorModule:
    def extract_artifacts(self, report_text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Uses Llama 3.1-70B-Versatile model
        # Temperature: 0.1 (low for consistent extraction)
        # Max tokens: 6000
        # Returns structured JSON with artifacts and metadata
```

#### Output Structure

```json
{
    "artifacts": [
        {
            "type": "artifact_type",
            "value": "artifact_value",
            "properties": {"key": "value"},
            "context": "discovery_context",
            "confidence": "high|medium|low"
        }
    ],
    "extraction_metadata": {
        "total_artifacts": 0,
        "high_confidence": 0,
        "medium_confidence": 0,
        "low_confidence": 0
    }
}
```

### Stage 2: Reasoning and Mapping Module

#### Purpose and Functionality
The Reasoning and Mapping Module represents the advanced reasoning component of the system. It takes the structured artifacts from Stage 1 and applies Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to map these artifacts to a strategic attack framework, establish causal and chronological relationships, and generate explicit natural language justifications for every inference (XAI - Explainable AI).

#### Strategic Attack Framework Mapping

The system maps artifacts to a three-dimensional strategic framework:

1. **TACTIC**: High-level attack objectives
   - Examples: "Initial Access", "Persistence", "Privilege Escalation", "Defense Evasion"
   
2. **TECHNIQUE**: Specific methods used
   - Examples: "Phishing", "Registry Run Key", "Process Injection", "Credential Dumping"
   
3. **PHASE**: Attack lifecycle stages
   - Examples: "Preparation", "Execution", "Maintenance", "Exfiltration"

#### Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Process

The module implements a systematic reasoning approach for each artifact:

1. **Technical Function Analysis**: "What is this artifact's technical function?"
2. **Tactical Role Identification**: "What attack tactic does it support?"
3. **Technique Mapping**: "What specific technique does it implement?"
4. **Phase Determination**: "What phase of the attack lifecycle is this?"
5. **Chronological Analysis**: "How does it relate to other artifacts chronologically?"
6. **Justification Generation**: "What is the explicit justification for this mapping?"

#### Causal Relationship Establishment

The system establishes both:
- **Chronological Relationships**: Temporal ordering of attack phases
- **Causal Relationships**: Dependencies between different attack components

#### Technical Implementation

```python
class ReasoningAndMappingModule:
    def reason_and_map(self, artifacts_json: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Uses Mixtral-8x7B-32768 model
        # Temperature: 0.3 (balanced for creative reasoning)
        # Max tokens: 8000
        # Returns comprehensive reasoning chains and mappings
```

#### Output Structure

    "reasoning_chains": [
        {
            "artifact_id": "artifact_identifier",
