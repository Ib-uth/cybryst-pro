Tool: Automated Knowledge Acquisition Layer v2.0

ATTACK NARRATIVE:
------------------------------
The attack begins with the 'Initial Access' phase, where the attacker gains access to the system using the 'Valid Accounts' technique. The attacker then establishes C2 infrastructure using the 'Application Window Discovery' technique, providing a means for the attacker to maintain control over the system. The attacker then uses the 'Domain Name System (DNS) Tunneling' technique to steal sensitive information. Finally, the attacker encrypts sensitive data using the 'Data Encrypted for Impact' technique, providing a means for the attacker to extort a ransom from the victim.

CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
------------------------------
Overall Confidence: high
Reasoning Quality: The reasoning quality is high, as the artifacts are mapped to the strategic attack framework using a clear and logical chain of reasoning.
