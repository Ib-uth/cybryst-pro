======================================================================

Source File: reports/nist_incident_response.txt
Analysis Date: 2025-10-08 09:30:56
Tool: Automated Knowledge Acquisition Layer v2.0

ATTACK NARRATIVE:
------------------------------
The attacker gains initial access to the system using valid accounts, executes malicious code using a malicious file, establishes command and control using a domain name, and escalates privileges using an exploited vulnerability. The attacker's goal is to gain access to sensitive data and maintain persistence within the network.

CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
------------------------------
Overall Confidence: high
Reasoning Quality: The reasoning quality is high due to the use of explicit justifications and causal relationships between phases.
