Tool: Automated Knowledge Acquisition Layer v2.0

ATTACK NARRATIVE:
------------------------------
The attack begins with the Preparation phase, where the attacker prepares the malicious file for distribution. The malicious file is used to establish an initial foothold on the host, and is followed by the Execution phase, where the attacker establishes communication with compromised hosts and issues commands. The attacker then establishes persistence on the host using a persistence mechanism, such as a registry run key. The overall attack narrative is a complex and multi-stage attack that involves multiple tactics and techniques.

CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
------------------------------
Overall Confidence: high
Reasoning Quality: The reasoning quality is high, as the attack timeline and overall attack narrative are well-supported by the artifacts and reasoning steps.
